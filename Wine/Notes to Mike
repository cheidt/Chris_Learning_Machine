From the face book log

1) Visualize the distributions of each numeric variable
2) Visualize each variable with respect to wine type, and quality score
3) Determine which numeric variables are correlated
4) Plot all numerics with respect to one-another
5) Propose a model, write out the steps to do predictions / inference in words
6) Based on your findings, give a qualitative explanation for which features might provide the best way to differentiate a white wine from a red wine, assuming that you couldn't look at the wine type ahead of time

Tasks 1 - 3 are mostly finished
I could not get Plot_Against_Color working.  Something to do with the dimensions of the axis

I am literally in and out of conciseness while working on this, so my idea of what a model is and isn't might need some work
Before getting to the writing it in plain text task though, my first thought is to take the correlation for quality to give
guidelines to making a better wine.  Second is to take the histograms and fit distributions to those, try to find
any parameter that clearly separates between white and red so that some sort of WID (Wine ID) can be preformed.
Ideally there would be a third thing, which is looking for distributions in multiple dimensions.  But I don't know
how to do that and I can think about it right now... because I am asleep.
